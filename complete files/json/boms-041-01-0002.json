The results show that the gadolinium moment isaligned antiparallel to that of transition metal atoms for both Co$_{16}$Cr$_7$GdSi$_8$ and Co$_{15}GdCr$_8$Si$_8$. The analysis of the doped material band structures shows that the half-metallic properties are completely conserved if Gd substitutes Cr atoms, while the minority-spin gap is filled and half-metallicity is lost when Gd substitutes Co atoms.", "keywords": "Half-metallic; spin polarization; Heusler alloys.", "pdf_url": "http://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/boms/041/01/0002", "html_url": "http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/boms/041/01/0002"}
