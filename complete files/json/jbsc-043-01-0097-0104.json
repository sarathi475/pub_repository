Aptamers are one of the mostly used and highly selective targeting agents for cancer cells. Herein, we address anano-sized targeted drug delivery approach adorned with A-172 glioblastoma cell-line-specific single stranded DNA(ssDNA) aptamer in which the chemotherapeutic agent Doxorubicin (DOX) had been conjugated. DNA aptamer, GMT-3,was previously selected for specific recognition of glioblastoma and represented many advantageous characteristics for drugtargeting purposes. Flow cytometry analysis proved the binding efficiency of the specific aptamer to tumour cell lines. Celltype-specific toxicity of GMT-3:DOX complex was showed by XTT assay and terminated cytotoxic effects were screenedfor both target cell and a control breast cancer cell line. The result of this contribution demonstrated the potential utility ofGMT-3 aptamer-mediated therapeutic drug transportation in the treatment of gliomas specifically. It was concluded thataptamer-mediated drug delivery can be applied successfully for clinical use.", "keywords": "A-172; aptamer; doxorubicin; glioblastoma; GMT-3; XTT", "pdf_url": "http://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/043/01/0097-0104", "html_url": "http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/jbsc/043/01/0097-0104"}
