The detachment of the printed ITO/Ag-grid layers from the glass substrate was carried out by dissolving ametallic sacrificial layer, which deposited on the glass substrate before the printing step. The optimum electrical and opticalperformance was obtained with Ag-grid pitch of 300 $\\mu$m, leading to the sheet resistance of 2 $\\Omega$ per sq and the transmittance of 85%.", "keywords": "Solution process; inkjet; electrohydrodynamic printing; transparent electrode; flexible electrode.", "pdf_url": "http://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/boms/041/01/0003", "html_url": "http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/boms/041/01/0003"}
